# Generating copyright headers in IntelliJ
Go to Preferences  > Editor > Copyright. Check the default project copyright. If it's not set, choose one. If you don't have any defined, go to the child pane Copyright Profiles and create a new one.

Copyright profiles are based on the Velocity template engine. Here's an example:

PROTECTIVELY MARKED: IL2 - PROTECT
Copyright (c) $today.year, MOPAC (Mayor's Officer for Policing and Crime), All Rights Reserved

Author: $username

There are several template variables available to use - see the link below for details:
