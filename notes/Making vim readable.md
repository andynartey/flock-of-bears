# Making vim readable
Sometimes the default colour scheme on vim makes essential parts of what you're editing unreadable (for instance, blue text on a black background for URLs). There are a couple of easy ways to get around this:

## Disable syntax highlighting
To completely disable syntax highlighting, enter the following command:

```
:set syn=off
```

## Change colour scheme
To change the colour scheme in use by the editor, enter the following command:

```
:colo desert
```

Where desert is the name of your preferred colour scheme. The available colour schemes are:

* blue
* darkblue
* default
* delek
* desert
* elflord
* evening
* koehler
* morning
* murphy
* pablo
* peachpuff
* ron
* shine
* slate
* torte
* zellner

You can download and install more colour schemes, if the basic ones aren't exciting enough:
