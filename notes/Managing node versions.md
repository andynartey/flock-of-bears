# Managing node versions
Details here: [https://davidwalsh.name/nvm](https://davidwalsh.name/nvm).

The previous approach of using the package 'n' to manage npm has turned out to be unstable, so this nvm approach is favoured.

1. 
Install nvm: [instructions](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.markdown)

2. 
Get a list of installed versions

`nvm ls`


3. Install a new version

```
`nvm install 6.10.1`
```

4. Use a particular installed version

```
`nvm use v6.10.1`
```
